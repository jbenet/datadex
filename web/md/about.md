# About Data & Datadex

`data` is a simple commandline tool with a supporting package index on the web. Use `data get` to find, download, and manage your datasets, and `data publish` to publish data to the world.

```
> data get jbenet/mnist
Installed jbenet/mnist@1.0 in datasets/jbenet/mnist/1.0.

> data publish
Published jbenet/cifar@1.1 (b53ce99).
```

`data` applies software engineering and distributed collaboration principles to data management. data's main goals are to:

- save time and reduce cognitive load
- simplify and support collaboration on datasets
- encourage broader publication + citation of datasets

data aims for simplicity. For now, it's rough around the edges, and it doesn't do much. Over time, data will be refined and features will be added (such as bittorrent and format conversion).

data is free open source software. Be sure to check out the project's repository, issue tracker, and mailing list. Your thoughts, ideas, bug-reports, pull-requests, and support are most welcome!
